wtf.js is a [JSFuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSFuck) compiler written in C.

## Usage

## How does this work?
wtf.js uses type coercion to produce working, yet unreadable javascript.

I recommed checking out [this video by Low Level Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRWE5tnaxlI) if you're interested in learning more.
